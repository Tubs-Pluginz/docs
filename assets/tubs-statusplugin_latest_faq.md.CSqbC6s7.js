For example: * `&amp;c` for Red, `&amp;a` for Green, `&amp;l` for Bold, `&amp;o` for Italic. * To set a status like &quot;&amp;cImportant &amp;lNotice&quot;, you would type: `/status &amp;cImportant&amp;_&amp;lNotice` * Use `&amp;_` to represent a space, as regular spaces might be trimmed by the command parser depending on your setup. * View all codes with `/status help colors`. </details><details><summary><b>Q: My status is getting cut off. Why?</b></summary> This is likely due to the `maxStatusLength` setting in `config.yml` (default is 15 characters). This limit applies to the *displayed* characters, not including color codes or PlaceholderAPI placeholders. An admin can change this limit with `/status setmaxlength &lt; length&gt;`. </details><details><summary><b>Q: Why isn&#39;t my status showing up in the tab list or chat?</b></summary> Check these settings in `config.yml`: * `changeTablistNames: true` (for tab list display) * `chatFormatter: true` (for status in chat messages) If these are true and it&#39;s still not working, ensure no other plugin is overriding tab list or chat formatting with higher priority. Also, tab list updates might sometimes require a player relog or server restart to fully propagate for all clients. The plugin does attempt to refresh tab names periodically. </details><details><summary><b>Q: Can I use PlaceholderAPI placeholders in my status?</b></summary> Yes! If PlaceholderAPI is installed on your server and you have the `StatusPlugin.placeholders` permission, you can include PAPI placeholders in your status message (e.g., `/status My balance: %vault_eco_balance%`). These will be parsed and displayed. </details><details><summary><b>Q: How does the LuckPerms prefix/suffix integration work?</b></summary> If LuckPerms is installed and you have the `StatusPlugin.placeholders` permission, you can use `%LP_prefix%` and `%LP_suffix%` in your status message. The plugin will replace these with your current LuckPerms prefix and suffix. For example: `/status %LP_prefix% &amp;7MyText &amp;f%LP_suffix%`. </details><details><summary><b>Q: What is &quot;Group Mode&quot; and how do I use it?</b></summary> If `groupMode: true` is set in `config.yml`: * Players cannot set custom statuses with `/status &lt; message&gt;`. * They must choose a status from predefined groups using `/group &lt; groupname&gt;` (or `/status group &lt; groupname&gt;`). * Groups are defined in `config.yml` under `statusGroups`. * To use a specific group, a player needs `StatusPlugin.group.set` AND `StatusPlugin.group.set.&lt; groupname&gt;` permissions. </details><details><summary><b>Q: Do statuses save if the server restarts?</b></summary> Yes, player statuses are saved to `plugins/TubsStatusPlugin/statuses.yml` and are reloaded when the server starts or when `/status reload` is used. </details><details><summary><b>Q: How often do PlaceholderAPI placeholders in statuses update in the tab list?</b></summary> The plugin schedules a task to refresh player display names (which includes parsing PAPI placeholders in statuses) in the tab list approximately every 30 seconds (600 game ticks) by default if `changeTablistNames: true`. </details><details><summary><b>Q: What if I use a color code I don&#39;t have permission for?</b></summary> The `StatusManager` attempts to strip formatting codes for which the player does not have the corresponding `StatusPlugin.formatting.&lt; type&gt;` permission. For example, if you try to use `&amp;c` (red) without `StatusPlugin.formatting.color`, the `&amp;c` might be removed, and the text will appear in the default color. </details><hr><p>Still stuck?
