The `LiquidFlowListener` and `BlockPlaceListener` also prevent liquids from flowing into or being placed directly onto the grave&#39;s player head. * **Explosions:** The `BlockExplodeListener` protects the grave&#39;s player head block from being destroyed by entity explosions (like creepers or TNT). The items inside are safe within the grave&#39;s data. </details><p><strong>Q: What happens if a player dies in a very tight space or in the void?</strong></p><details><summary>Click to expand details</summary> BTGraves attempts to find a suitable 2-block high air space near the death location. * It searches a small radius downwards, then upwards. * If the death occurs below the world&#39;s minimum build height (e.g., falling into the void in the Overworld/End, or below Y=0 in the Nether), it will try to place the grave at Y=minY+1 (e.g., Y=1 in Nether/End, Y=-63 in Overworld). * If no suitable air pocket is found after these checks, the grave might be placed at the original death location, potentially overwriting non-solid blocks or being partially embedded if space is extremely limited. The goal is always to place the grave. </details><p><strong>Q: How much XP is saved? Can I change it?</strong></p><details><summary>Click to expand details</summary> By default, 100% of the player&#39;s XP (both levels and progress to the next level) is saved. You can change this using the `expPercentage` setting in `config.yml`. Set it to a value between `0` (save no XP) and `100` (save all XP). </details><p><strong>Q: What happens when a grave expires (<code>graveTimeout</code>)?</strong></p><details><summary>Click to expand details</summary> If `graveTimeout` is set to a positive number (minutes): 1. The grave&#39;s internal timer counts up. 2. If the timer exceeds the `graveTimeout`, the grave is marked as &quot;expired&quot;. 3. **Crucially, for the items to drop, a player must be within a 50-block radius of the expired grave, AND the chunk containing the grave must be loaded.** 4. When these conditions are met, all items from the grave and the saved XP (as orbs) are dropped at the grave&#39;s location. The player head and armor stand are then removed. If `graveTimeout` is `-1`, graves never expire. </details><p><strong>Q: Can other players access my grave?</strong></p><details><summary>Click to expand details</summary> - **By default, no.** Only the player who died (the owner of the grave) can open their grave by right-clicking its armor stand. <br> - **Admins:** Players with the `btgraves.admin.open` permission can use the `/grave open &lt; graveId&gt;` command to open any grave if they know its ID. </details><p><strong>Q: What if the server crashes or restarts while graves are active?</strong></p><details><summary>Click to expand details</summary> BTGraves saves active grave data to `graves.yml` periodically (every 10 seconds by default) and when the plugin is disabled. When the server restarts and BTGraves loads, it reads `graves.yml` to restore active graves, including their contents, locations, and timers. This ensures persistence across restarts. </details><p><strong>Q: Does BTGraves work with <code>keepInventory = true</code> gamerule?</strong></p><details><summary>Click to expand details</summary> No. If the `keepInventory` gamerule is set to `true` in a world, players will not drop items or XP upon death, so BTGraves will not create a grave for them in that world. BTGraves is designed for servers where `keepInventory` is `false`. </details><p><strong>Q: How is the grave&#39;s remaining time displayed?</strong></p><details><summary>Click to expand details</summary> If a player is within a 50-block radius of an active (non-expired) grave, the grave&#39;s armor stand name tag will dynamically update to show the remaining time (e.g., &quot;PlayerName&#39;s Grave - 00h 58m 12s&quot;). The time is colored: * **Green:** Plenty of time left. * **Gold/Yellow:** Time is about halfway through. * **Red:** Nearing expiration. This update happens roughly every second if a player is nearby. </details><p><strong>Q: Can I disable the player head for graves? Or change the grave block?</strong></p><details><summary>Click to expand details</summary> Currently, BTGraves always places a player head (skinned to the deceased player) and uses an invisible armor stand. There isn&#39;t a configuration option to change the grave block or disable the head in the provided version. </details><hr><p>If your question isn&#39;t answered here, please check the <a href="./troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting Guide</a> or join our <a href="https://discord.pluginz.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Discord Community</a> for further assistance!</p>',23)]))}const m=a(o,[["render",i]]);export{g as __pageData,m as default};
