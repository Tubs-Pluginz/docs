It applies when an <strong>active server (that had players)</strong> becomes empty. The countdown for shutdown begins after the last player leaves.</li><li><strong><code>idleStartShutdownTime</code>:</strong> This is a <em>global</em> setting. It applies if a server is <strong>started by VPP</strong> (e.g., due to a player connection attempt or a command) but <strong>no player successfully joins it</strong> within this specified duration. It&#39;s a safeguard to shut down servers that were initiated but never actually used.</li></ul></details><p><strong>Q: Why does it sometimes take a moment for me to connect to a server after VPP starts it?</strong></p><details><summary>Click to expand details</summary> This is likely due to the `startupJoinDelay` setting, configured per-server in `config.yml`. This delay is intentionally added *after* VPP detects the server as &quot;online&quot; (via `serverStatusCheckMethod`). It gives the backend Minecraft server and its plugins additional time to fully initialize and load before VPP attempts to transfer the player. Without this, players might be connected too early, before the server is truly ready to accept them. </details><h2 id="shutdown-issues" tabindex="-1">Shutdown Issues <a class="header-anchor" href="#shutdown-issues" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Shutdown Issues&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Q: Servers aren&#39;t stopping automatically when they become empty.</strong></p><details><summary>Click to expand details</summary><ul><li><strong><code>timeout</code> Setting:</strong> For the specific server in <code>config.yml</code>, is <code>timeout:</code> set to a positive number (seconds)? <ul><li>If <code>timeout: -1</code>, automatic shutdown for that server is disabled.</li><li>If <code>timeout: 0</code>, it should attempt to stop immediately (though panel processing takes time).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Velocity Console Logs:</strong> Enable debug logging.

What about different Panel installations?</strong></p><details><summary>Click to expand details</summary><ul><li><p><strong>Multiple Nodes (Wings/Daemon) under a Single Panel: YES</strong> VelocityPteroPower connects to one specific Panel installation (defined by the pterodactyl.url in config.yml). This single Panel installation can (and typically does) manage game servers running on many different physical or virtual machines, which are known as Nodes (running the Pterodactyl Wings or Pelican Daemon software). VPP can manage any game server that is registered under that one Panel, regardless of which Node it&#39;s hosted on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multiple, Separate Panel Installations: NO (with a single VPP instance)</strong> A single instance of VelocityPteroPower is designed to communicate with only one Panel installation at a time. If you have completely separate Pterodactyl or Pelican panel installations (e.g., panel1.example.com and panel2.example.com), you cannot manage servers from both of these distinct panels with a single VPP plugin instance. To manage servers across entirely separate panel installations, you would theoretically need to run separate, isolated Velocity proxy instances, each with its own VPP plugin configured to point to its respective panel. This is generally not a common or straightforward setup.</p></li></ul></details><hr><p>If your question isn&#39;t answered here, please check the <a href="./troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting Guide</a> or join our <a href="https://discord.pluginz.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Discord Community</a> for further assistance!</p>',25)]))}const m=t(r,[["render",n]]);export{h as __pageData,m as default};
