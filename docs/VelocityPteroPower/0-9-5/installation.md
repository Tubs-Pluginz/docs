# Installation Guide ðŸš€

Installing VelocityPteroPower on your Velocity server is a simple process:

1.  **Download the Plugin:**
    Obtain the latest `.jar` file for VelocityPteroPower from its official release page:
    *   [Modrinth (Recommended)](https://modrinth.com/plugin/velocitypteropower)
    *   [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/TubYoub/VelocityPteroPower/releases)

2.  **Place the Plugin File:**
    Locate your Velocity server's `plugins` folder and place the downloaded `VelocityPteroPower-x.y.z.jar` file into it.

3.  **Start/Restart Your Server:**
    Start or restart your Velocity proxy server.

    ::: info First Launch
    On its first launch, VelocityPteroPower will:
    *   Generate its main configuration file: `plugins/VelocityPteroPower/config.yml`
    *   Create a `messages/` folder with language files (e.g., `en_US.yml`, `de_DE.yml`) under `plugins/VelocityPteroPower/messages/`.
      - Note: the old single `messages.yml` file is deprecated and no longer used.
    :::

4.  **Initial Configuration:**
    Stop your Velocity server again. Now, open the generated `plugins/VelocityPteroPower/config.yml` and configure it according to your panel details and server setup. This step is crucial for the plugin to function correctly.

    Refer to the [Configuration Guide](configuration.md) for detailed explanations of all options.
    If you plan to use multiple lobbies/limbos, see the simple [Lobbies & Limbo guide](lobbies-and-limbo.md).

5.  **Final Restart:**
    After configuring `config.yml`, start your Velocity server one more time.

::: tip Check Your Logs!
After installation and configuration, always check your Velocity console logs for any messages from `[VPP]` or `VelocityPteroPower`. This will help you confirm if the plugin loaded correctly and if it successfully connected to your panel API.

That's it! VelocityPteroPower should now be installed and ready to manage your servers.

# Installation

1. Place the VelocityPteroPower jar into your Velocity plugins folder and restart the proxy.
2. Edit `plugins/VelocityPteroPower/config.yml`.
3. Under the `servers:` section, define each managed server.

Important: Always quote the `id` under each server. Example:

servers:
  mc-vanilla-6:
    id: "91e62747"  # quoted to avoid YAML scientific-notation parsing
    timeout: 30
    startupJoinDelay: 10
    whitelist: true

If you omit the quotes (id: 91e62747), YAML may parse it as a number in scientific notation, resulting in an invalid value like `Infinity`. The plugin will warn and skip such entries.
