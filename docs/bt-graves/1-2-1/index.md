BT Graves is a Spigot/Paper plugin designed to enhance the player death experience by creating a physical grave at the location of death. These graves securely store the player's items and a configurable percentage of their experience points, allowing them to retrieve their belongings safely.

Never lose your hard-earned gear to lava or despawning again! BT Graves provides a fair and configurable way to handle player deaths.

::: tip Key Idea
When a player dies, instead of items scattering, a grave (represented by a player head and an invisible armor stand) is created. The player can then return to their grave to retrieve their inventory and saved XP.
